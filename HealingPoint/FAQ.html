<p><b>How does Chinese Herbal Medicine work?</b></p>
<p>Chinese Herbal Medicine is comprised of over 365 herbs. Each individual herb is understood by its nature, taste, temperature, and the meridians it enters. Herbs are the precursors for pharmaceutical drugs but offer less side effects since they are kept in their whole form. Chinese herbs consist of the leaf, stem, flower, or root of a plant as well as some minerals and animal products. A formula is a combination of herbs tailored for each individual based on their Oriental Medicine diagnosis. Each ingredient is purposefully used to create a balanced interaction within a given formula. Herbal therapy can be used alone or in conjunction with acupuncture treatments.</p>
